# QGIS_Project_Manager
Project Manager Plugin for EPA H2O Ecological Valuation Tool. Built with core components of QGIS 1.8 and a highly customized plugin, "Project Manager". Project Manager may sit where QGIS add-on plugins sit, but it's python functions drive the UX, UI, and Geoprocesses that make the standalone tool simple and powerful.
